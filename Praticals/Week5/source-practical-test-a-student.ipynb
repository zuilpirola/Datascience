    "\n",
    "1. You cannot speak to other students once that evaluation starts.\n",
    "2. There will be 15 minutes at the beginning where you can ask questions, and 5 min in the middle, and another 5 min towards the end of the test. Wait for your professor to indicate when you can ask questions.\n",

    "Your goal in this evaluation is to explore a dataset on young people being exposed to advertising of video games that have weapons and fighting in them. There are just three columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `exposure_mins`: how many minutes a person was exposed to the adverts\n",
    "2. `gender`: the person's gender\n",
    "3. `buying_close_score`: a score between 0-100 that indicates how close a person was to buying the game (100 means they bought it)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1. Produce scatter plot for a. Males, b. Females where you can see analytically whether there may be a relationship betwen exposure_mins and buying_close_score\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Were boys and girls exposed to the adverts similarly in terms of exposure minutes, use box plots and answer analitically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Produce a regression model for a pair of variables you think may be related from your analitical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the independent and dependent variables?\n",
    "- Describe the relationship you will study, for example, females watch more adverts\n",
    "- Obtain $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ using a naive approach or the Python libraries you explored in the lab sessions\n",
    "- Obtain the Confidence Intervals for the two coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Produce a box plot array with two box plots that show the buying_close_score for a. boys who spent 5 min or less watching adverts and b. those who spent more than 5 min. Interpret your results analytically\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Repeat Q4 but for girls. "
